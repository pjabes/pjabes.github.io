      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of hype with Security Orchestration, Automation and Response (SOAR) and on paper it basically sells itself. A product that improves Time To Respond (TTR) metrics whilst decreasing FTE count is a CISO&amp;rsquo;s wet dream. But unfortunately, many orgs find it difficult to realise value with their SOAR products and in a way are soaring by the seat of their pants.
This blog post provides some (no marketting) recommendations on how you can realise the most value from your SOAR investment.</description>
