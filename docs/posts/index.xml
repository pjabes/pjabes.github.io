      <description>Conceptually, Security Orchestration, Automation and Response (SOAR) is a CISO&amp;rsquo;s wet-dream. Among things it&amp;rsquo;s often sold as a way of reducing FTE, improving metrics such as TTR and a manner of minimising attrition and/or analyst fatigue. When done right, this is all true. But unfortunately, many orgs find it difficult to reach value realisation with SOAR and in a way, are soaring by the seat of their pants.
This blog post details some of my experiences, and recommendations, on how to realise the most value from your SOC.</description>
